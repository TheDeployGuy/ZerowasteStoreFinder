        <p>This website was created on our free time to benefit the Zero Waste community
        and we are happy to help out. However we are paying for the hosting and domain registration out of own pockets.
        The cost to run this site is â‚¬100+ per year(which includes 12 months of hosting and domain name registration). We don't like asking for money and we want to keep this site up  for a long time so any donations would be greatly appricated</p>
        <p>We completely understand that not everyone has the money to donate so please only donate if you can. If you can't donate sharing the site with your friends and family would be greatly appricated.</p>
